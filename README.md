# Material for the Operating Systems lab

This repository contains material required to complete the OS lab in my groups (3 and 4) in the 2017 summer semester, including exercise sheets and their associated materials (in the exN directories).

Note that some of this material is based on previos years, and/or originally authored by Alexander Hirsch.
